1. Basic - Print all integers from 0 to 150.
	for x in range(0, 150, 1):
    	print(x)

2. Multiples of Five - Print all the multiples of 5 from 5 to 1,000
	for x in range(5, 1000, 5):
    	print(x)

3. Counting, the Dojo Way - Print integers 1 to 100. If divisible by 5, print "Coding" instead. If divisible by 10, print "Coding Dojo".
	for i in range (1,101):
    	if i % 5 == 0:
        print ("Coding")
   	if i % 10 == 0:
        print ("Coding Dojo")
4. Whoa. That Sucker's Huge - Add odd integers from 0 to 500,000, and print the final sum.
	minimum = int(input(" Please Enter the Minimum Value : ")) 
	maximum = int(input(" Please Enter the Maximum Value : "))
	Oddtotal = 0

	for number in range(minimum, maximum+1):
   	if(number % 2 != 0):
        print("{0}".format(number))
        Oddtotal = Oddtotal + number

	print("The Sum of Odd Numbers from {0} to {1} = {2}".format(minimum, maximum, Oddtotal))

5. Countdown by Fours - Print positive numbers starting at 2018, counting down by fours.
	for c in range(2017,0,-4):
    	c +=1
    	print ("countdown by four:", c)

OR
	number = 2018
	while number > 0:
   	print (number)
   	number = number - 4

6. Flexible Counter - Set three variables: lowNum, highNum, mult. Starting at lowNum and going through highNum, print only the integers that are a multiple of mult. For example, if lowNum=2, highNum=9, and mult=3, the loop should print 3, 6, 9 (on successive lines)
